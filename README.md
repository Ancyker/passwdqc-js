# Passwdqc-js
=============

## About

Passwdqc-js is a JavaScript port of [passwdqc](http://openwall.com/passwdqc/), the brilliant password quality checker library, made by [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/). Passwdqc-js provides ability to evaluate passwords quality directly in a browser. 

## Compatibilty w/ Passwdqc

Passwdqc-js was tested for compatibility with original passwdqc. We used following password databases in order to guarantee that both accept the **same** subset of passwords:

* 14M unique RockYou passwords from 2009 leak
* 10K random 10-character symbolic passwords
* 10K random pass phrases, generated by pwqgen (part of original passwdqc)

## Usage
Use `passwdqc.check(newpass, [oldpass], [params], [gecos])` function to check password quality.

**Parameters**

* **newpass**: password to check
* **oldpass**: old password, will be used to determine if new password is based on it
* **params**: custom parameters for passwdqc algorithm, [see](http://www.openwall.com/passwdqc/README.shtml)
* **gecos**: optional structure with UNIX-like pwd fields

**Return value**

* Empty string if password is considered good;
* The reason why password is considered weak, otherwise.

### Example

	var passwdqc = require('passwdqc_check');
	
	var rv = passwdqc.check(password, old_password);
	
	if (!rv) {
		// Password is of good quality
		// ...
	} else {
		// The "rv" now contains reason why password considered weak
	}
	
## TODO
* More examples
* Reference implementation for password meter with visual feedback
* Random password/passphrase generator
